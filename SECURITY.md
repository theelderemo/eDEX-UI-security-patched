### Reporting a Vulnerability
I take all security reports seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please use one of the following methods to report it:

GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting: The preferred method is to privately report the vulnerability directly on this GitHub repository. This ensures the issue is disclosed responsibly. Click on the "Security" tab and then "Report a vulnerability."

Create a GitHub Issue: If you are unable to report privately, you can open an issue in the repository. Please do not include sensitive details, proof-of-concept exploits, or any information that could be used to harm others in a public issue. Describe the nature of the vulnerability, and I will create a private channel to discuss the details.

When reporting, please include as much information as possible, such as:

A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.

Steps to reproduce the issue.

The version of the software you are using.

You can expect an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours. I am committed to working with you to understand and resolve the issue in a timely manner.
