eDEX-UI is a fullscreen, cross-platform terminal emulator and system monitor that looks and feels like a sci-fi computer interface.

This is a community-driven fork of the original eDEX-UI, which was archived in October 2021. This fork aims to revive the project, apply security patches, and continue its development.

# üõ°Ô∏è Security Fix Information
- CVE: Not assigned (discovered post-archive)
- Severity: Critical
- Impact: Remote Command Execution via WebSocket hijacking

## Vulnerability Details
The original eDEX-UI contained a security vulnerability where malicious websites could connect to the internal terminal control WebSocket and execute arbitrary shell commands on the user's system.

## The Fix
This fork implements proper origin validation for WebSocket connections:
- Only accepts connections from the local Electron application (file:// protocol)
- Rejects all web-based connection attempts (http://, https://)
- Logs rejected connection attempts for security monitoring
- Fixed in: `src/classes/terminal.class.js`
